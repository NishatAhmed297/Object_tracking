# Object Tracking
Image Processing is widely used in many practical appliaction. One of which is object tracking. It is useful in keeping track of certain object in a video stream and keep it in fouces as long as it is in the frame.
In this project, I have implemented a similiar technique to detect 3 electronic circuits in a video stream and keep their count. I have used OpenCV library in Python.
## Tools and Libraries Used
• Python <br/>
• OpenCV <br/>
# Object Detection
Object tracking is the first part. Next part is to detect the class of object. For this A yolov3 model was trained. Darknet architecture is used in this project.<br/>

### To run this project
1. run main.py file
