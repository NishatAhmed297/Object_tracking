# Object_tracking
Image Processing is widely used in many practical appliaction. One of which is object tracking. It is useful in keeping track of certain object in a video stream and keep it in fouces as long as it is in the frame.
In this project, I have implemented a similiar technique to detect 3 electronic circuits in a video stream and keep their count. I have used OpenCV library in Python.
